The User agrees that their interaction with the contract constitutes active participation under the terms outlined in this agreement. Furthermore, the User accepts that there are no promises of returns, financial or otherwise, from their engagement with the contract.

## Article V - Amendments, Modifications, and Governance
Due to the decentralized nature of the contract, the Developer does not retain unilateral control to modify or replace this agreement or the contract's code post-deployment. Amendments or modifications to the contract are governed by the collective decision-making of its users or designated governance bodies, according to the predefined rules set within the contract's code or the governing blockchain protocol. Users recognize that changes to the contract, including this agreement, may occur through these decentralized governance mechanisms without prior notice. Continued interaction with the contract following any modifications signifies acceptance of these changes.

The Developer disclaims all liability for any damages, direct or indirect, resulting from the use or inability to use these tools. Users agree to assume full responsibility for the risks associated with using these web tools and acknowledge that the Developer's creation and maintenance of such tools do not imply liability for their uninterrupted use or performance.

## Article VII - Final Acknowledgment
By engaging in any form of interaction with the contract's code, whitepaper, or any associated tools or websites developed for contract facilitation, the User explicitly acknowledges and consents to all terms outlined in this agreement. This interaction symbolizes the User's comprehensive understanding of the contract's status as a public utility, the inherent risks associated, and their full acceptance of the disclaimers regarding warranty and liability. Importantly, the User agrees that any direct or indirect use of the contract and its related platforms shall in no way render the Developer liable for any outcomes. The User's participation is a clear indication of their agreement to absolve the Developer of all potential liabilities, acknowledging that their interaction is entirely at their own risk.

This agreement sets forth the entire understanding between the User and the Developer regarding the contract and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral.
